PICKUP NOTES — LPJmL work (snapshot)

Date: 2025-10-30
Status: paused — ready to resume later

Summary
-------
This file captures the current state of the LPJmL work so you can pause this chat and start a new one for another topic. Resume from the exact place below when you're ready.

Key outcomes achieved
---------------------
- LPJmL run for Spain (1901-1910) completed; outputs and run log available.
- R analysis scripts created and committed: `analysis_plots.R`, `map_cells_nosf.R`, `lpjmlkit.R`, and helper extractors.
- `.gitignore` updated and committed to ignore `lpjm_inputs_spain/`, `spain_sim/output/`, `spain_sim/outputs/`, and `figures/`.
- Verification folder archived.

Where to find things (paths)
----------------------------
- Repo root: /home/jvt/test-lpjmlkit
- Grid binary: lpjm_inputs_spain/gadm/grid_gadm_30arcmin.bin
- Optional grid JSON header (if present): lpjm_inputs_spain/gadm/grid_gadm_30arcmin.bin.json
- R scripts: gridbin_to_clm/scripts/ and top-level scripts (analysis_plots.R, map_cells_nosf.R)
- Quick detector/dumper outputs (if run): tmp/grid_all_cells.csv or tmp/grid_detect.csv
- LPJmL run outputs: spain_sim/output/ (symlink) and spain_sim/outputs/y1901_1910/
- Last committed JSON config: spain_sim/configurations/config_hdr_run.json (commit af5312f)

Current blockers / unresolved
----------------------------
- cells_coords.csv (the CSV containing lon/lat for the 350 LPJmL cells) produced by earlier detectors looks implausible (lon nearly constant / wrong ranges). Need to finalize scalar/endianness/order to get correct lon/lat.
- `sf` installation on WSL not completed (system libs missing). Fallback `map_cells_nosf.R` exists and works if coords are correct.

Next actionable steps to resume
------------------------------
1) Re-run the stronger detector/dumper to try more scalar/order candidates. Use `gridbin_to_clm/scripts/dump_grid_coords_detect_more.R` or the safe wrapper `gridbin_to_clm/scripts/grid_cells_extract_safe.R`.

2) Validate the produced CSV quickly:
   - head -n 12 cells_coords.csv
   - wc -l cells_coords.csv
   - awk script to print lon/lat min/max (see README or ask assistant)

3) If coords look plausible (lon roughly -10..6, lat 28..46) run the quick no-sf plot:
   - Rscript scripts/quick_plot_cells.R cells_coords.csv figures/cells_map_spain_nosf.png

4) If plot looks correct, commit the final artifacts:
   - git add cells_coords.csv figures/cells_map_spain_nosf.png
   - git commit -m "Add final cells coords and Spain map"
   - git push origin main

5) Optional: install system deps for `sf` in WSL if you prefer richer mapping:
   - sudo apt update; sudo apt install -y cmake libudunits2-dev gdal-bin libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgeos-dev
   - Then in R: install.packages('sf') or run `renv::restore()` in project

Notes on remotes
----------------
- Current `origin` is: git@github.com:Jauviltra/test-lpjmlkit-snapshot.git (pushed recent commits df6876e -> af5312f)
- If you want to push to your normal repo `test-lpjmlkit`, add a new remote or change `origin` URL.

If you want to resume here
-------------------------
When you return to LPJmL, paste the `head -n 12` output of the cells CSV and the lon/lat min/max output (or attach the CSV), and I will diagnose the scalar/endianness/order and produce the correct `cells_coords.csv` and map.

Starting a new chat for a different topic
----------------------------------------
- In the chat UI you can start a new conversation/thread; I recommend starting the new topic there. If you want the assistant to keep context from this work, paste or reference this PICKUP_LPJML.md file in the new chat.
- If you prefer that I create an issue in GitHub for the LPJmL work or a branch to work in parallel, tell me and I can prepare the commands.
